- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#4B0082) to evoke spirituality and depth.
- Background color: Cream (#F8F3E3), a desaturated hue of the primary, for a calming backdrop.
- Accent color: Saffron (#FF9933), analogous to indigo, for highlights and call-to-action elements.
- Headings: 'Cormorant Garamond' (serif) for an elegant, spiritual feel. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Body: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for readability and a modern touch.
- Use Lottie animations for spiritual SVG icons such as mandalas and chakra symbols with a glowing effect.
- Implement scroll-based animations like fade-ins and parallax effects, and consider optional ambient audio (OM or Tibetan bowls) with a toggle for muting.
